This repository holds all text and code used for the introductory text to my thesis "Computational modelling of the coastal Mesolithic in south-eastern Norway". 

Rmarkdown documents for the individual chapters are labelled 01-08. Pre-compiled figures are available in the directory *figures*. Code and data for assembling Figure 5.1. is available in the *R* directory. The compiled version of the entire introductory text is available as *docs/thesis.pdf*. Due to the resulting file-size, this is not compiled with the papers or supplementary material accompanying these, which are included through *08-papers.md*. The complete thesis can be compiled by editing *_bookdwown.yml* to include *08-papers.md* before buidling the bookdown document. The individual papers are available in PDF versions in the *paper* directory. These papers are:
