# Analytical background

This chapter presents underlying analytical concepts that have motivated the studies undertaken for this thesis.

## The scope and quality of the archaeological record

sses have produced them. The degree to which this occurs therefore impacts the hope we have of ever choosing between competing explanations, and is for archaeology especially pertinent as we deal with fragmented empirical record fraught with various systematic and un-systematic biases that impact the quality of our data.    

The quality of the data available to us is consequently fundamental for knowing what questions we can and cannot hope to answer about the past. Lower quality data will lead to averaging and smoothing, where for example a reduced temporal resolution can lead to chronological smearing that hides smaller scale oscillations and variability [@bailey2007]. The same principle extends to the spatial scale, where a lower empirical coverage means that answers to questions pertaining to processes operating at the scale of individuals, sites or smaller regions might not be empirically tractable, and a larger view might be necessary to achieve the empirical coverage necessary to bring into view the processes of interest. Furthermore, this issue also pertains to what @perreault2019 terms the dimensionality of the data, Loss will here result in a reduction of variability and richness, for example in the composition of artefact assemblages. 

Furthermore, loss and mixing can be more subtle effects than complete absence of data, which can potentially be more easily recognised and thereby accounted for. Moreover, effects such as loss, mixing of past events and analytical lumping will most likely not impact the quality of the data in a uniform way. Taphonomic loss is likely to be more severe the further back in time one moves [@surovell2009a], and analytical bias following from disciplinary interests or what geographical areas have been subjected to archaeological investigation will also skew our impression of the past [@binford1964]. Mapping the spatial and temporal quality of the archaeological record is thus critical for knowing what past processes we would be able to discern, and by extension what kind of archaeology we can hope to do.

A central aim of this thesis is to contribute to mapping the data available to us. While there can be merit to accumulating large amounts of data, as this can average out idiosyncratic and random variation or erroneous data points, more data will not, by itself, [@huggett2020]. Discussing this in the context of \'Big Data\' in archaeology, @huggett2020 states that  \'digital data not only offer possibilities but may also constrain actions, they limit as well as enable, and this may not always be recognized in the thrill of the revolutionary discourses surrounding Big Data and the lack of a proper data gaze.\' While seeing data as given, free of influence from our preconceptions have long been critisised in archaeology, several authors have expressed concerns with the degree to which developments in digital technology may lead to an over-enthusiasm that neglects the the messy, fragmentary and complex nature of archaeological data, and that this can lead to fetishisation of digital data following from its availability, tractability and often elegant results [@huggett2020]. 

While large amounts of data do not offer a way to side-step the fundamental issues with archaeological evidence, there is nonetheless decidedly value to evaluating data at multiple scales. Not only can this reveal patterns and processes that operate at some scales and not at others, but different scales of perspective can also feed back to each other and reveal biases or inconsistencies. A central issue with digital data is therefore transparency with regards to its creation, manipulation, handling and finally with how it is cast as evidence. This will allow ourselves and others to assess how these steps might influence the arguments that are made. How this is attempted to be tackled in this context will be laid out in more detail in the next chapter.

## Chronology, archaeological cultures and modifiable analytical units

The study area of this thesis, as situated firmly within south-eastern Norway, is for the most part believed to have followed the same unified trajectory in terms of overall cultural-historical developments and expressions of material culture through the Mesolithic. At least within the analytical detection limit that has characterised the field thus far. What has been of greater concern is the temporal transition between the occurrence of cultural taxonomic elements within the region. In Norwegian Mesolithic research more widely, however, the question of both regional variation in material culture and its timing has led to discussions of whether a concept known as \'chronozones\' has any merit as a framework for systematising the archaeological material. While this is a concept that has remained marginal in archaeology as a whole, as it is mainly used by some practitioners in Norwegian Mesolithic archaeology [e.g. @bjerck2008; @nyland2016; @fretheim2017; @breivik2018; @skar2018], it is related to fundamental issues faced within archaeology in general.

The concept originates in a paper by @bjerck1986, in which he attempts to tackle the distinction between the archaeologically defined cultures of Fosna and Nøstvet in the context of Western Norway. Instead of an ever-continued nuancing of these terms as more variation and idiosyncrasies are encountered in the archaeological record, @bjerck1986[117--119] instead suggests a division of the Mesolithic period into a series of time-intervals denoted chronozones, originally at a resolution of 500 years, which he argues could facilitate a Pan-Scandinavian framework for approaching the Mesolithic [@bjerck2008, 72--73]. The concept of chronozones is taken from the geosciences, where the term is used to denote stratigraphic layers that formed over the same specific time-span on a regional or world-wide scale, known from geochronological units such as for example the Preboreal, Boreal and Atlantic time-intervals [e.g. @salvador1994, 83--85]. Bjerck's motivation for adapting this to archaeology is to form a framework that is neutral with respect to cultural variation across space and time. He argues that traditional archaeological units of analysis, typically denoted by terms such as cultures or techno-complexes that are discretely delineated in time and space, has led to an artificial partitioning of the archaeological material that is less open to gradual temporal change and spatial variation -- an issue that has been contended with by many archaeologists through the years [e.g. @childe1956, 121--125; @butzer1982, 279--320; @smith1992; @clark2009; @roberts2011; @reynolds2017]. Bjerck argues that the use of neutral 500-year time-intervals will reduce the degree to which analyses will overemphasise homogeneity within, and exaggerate differences between such analytical units. To further illustrate the issues Bjerck attempted to tackle, it is useful with a detour via the concepts of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), as taken from the field of geography [e.g. @harris2006], and its recently coined temporal equivalent, the Modifiable Temporal Unit Problem [MTUP, @bevan2021].

### The MAUP and MTUP

The scale problem, as its often called, is central to geographical research. This follows from the chosen scale for the necessary generalisation of continuous phenomena, it's dependency on the density of sampling points for this data, and the variable spatial scales that different phenomena operate across [@harvey1968]. Some central implications @haggett1965 identifies in relation to this is the *scale-coverage problem* which is related to the variable areal coverage between studies, the *scale-linkage problem*; the problem of comparing results captured at one spatial scale with those captured at another, and the *scale-standardisation problem*; the issue of how to adjust data that have been captured on varying spatial scales [@harris2006, 46]. Extending on the last problem, @haggett1965 shows how adjusting the boundaries used to delineate the originally retrieved data can have substantial impacts on any basic comparisons of occurrence of phenomena, which is the issue that underlies the MAUP.   

The MAUP is defined by @heywood2002[8] as \'a problem arising from the imposition of artificial units of spatial reporting on continuous geographical phenomenon resulting in the generation of artificial spatial patterns\' and is an issue that underlies most if not all analyses that draw on areal data [@harris2006, 48]. A typical example from archaeology is the areal unit of the site, the delineation of which typically follows some notion of concentration of artefacts. However, the density of artefacts over a landscape can be conceived of a continuous phenomena, and so it's definition will always be modifiable and subject to choice, whether it follows from some kind of statistical procedure or a more intuitive definition. The same problem extends to the smaller scale, such as with the definition of site features based on the concentration of charcoal, and up in scale, such as to the definition of archaeological cultural areas. How these units are defined will impact the most basic comparison between them. Given the arbitrariness and potential variation that might exists in the aggregation procedures underlying our areal units, it is therefore always a danger that discovered patterns could simply be artefacts of the aggregation technique.     

These issues can also be extended to the temporal scale, with @bevan2021 recently having given a demonstration of how archaeological periodisation involving lumping and splitting of phenomena within disjoint time-intervals have analytical consequences that remain under-appreciated within archaeology. First, employing strict cut-offs between temporal units -- units that often also vary in their duration -- has major implications for comparison between these units, and can, as @bjerck2008[73] also notes, lead to an artificial and inadvertent overemphasis of the transition between these. Basic operations such as comparing counts will be skewed by variable duration of these units, and the position of breaks between them can be highly influential to the appearance of the frequency distribution of events over time.

Building on @crema2020, @bevan2021 further define three types of uncertainty associated with this archaeological practice. The first is *phase-assignment uncertainty* -- how certain can we be that a given phenomena can be ascribed to a given phase. The degree to which this varies between different material categories means that it can be difficult to compare their frequency across archaeological phases. As was found in the third paper for this thesis [@roalkvam2022], the occurrence of formal tool types at the Mesolithic sites in the study appears to be greater further back in time. This as opposed to younger sites, which are to a larger extent dominated by generic debitage that can be more difficult to assign to a phase. This can have implications for how many sites are ascribed earlier periods, and, by extension, could impact a comparison between phases. The second pertains to the *within-phase uncertainty*, the degree to which the occurrence of a various phenomena have an equal likelihood of occurrence throughout an archaeological phase. For example, in typological discussions for the Norwegian Mesolithic, the occurrence of different artefacts types is in practice typically treated as having a uniform occurrence within a given time-span.  The final dimensions @bevan2021 highlight is the *phase boundary uncertainty*, which pertains to the start and end points of the archaeological phases themselves. As these are typically defined by a complex interplay of multiple cultural phenomena, they are seldom meant to operate on the scale of individual years, but will in practice often be operationalised as such. 

### Archaeological chronozones

While possible methodological ways around these issues are presented in the works cited above, neither the MAUP nor the MTUP have any clear solutions, and the magnitude of their impact will depend on the given research question and accompanying analytical scale. However, their formulation arguably form a better frame for understanding these issues than the concept of chronozones. I believe chronozones can instead obfuscate the distinction between the temporal and the spatial scale, and that it can lead to a conflation of typology -- understood in its widest possible sense -- as a methodology for systematising archaeological material and its potential use as a dating method. As @bjerck1987 states, typology obviously has its place as a culturally responsive framework in both time and space. Chronozones, on the other hand, are supposed to make comparisons across typologically inferred boundaries in space and time tractable. 

In her comment to Bjerck's paper, @skar1987[35] notes that geological chronozones couple pan-regional stratigraphic layers with the calendar scale, but that there is no equivalent pan-regional archaeological phenomena that equally consistently correspond to a section of the calendar scale. As @bjerck1987[40] further underscores in his response, archaeological chronozones are therefore not, unlike typological frameworks, meant to be culturally responsive, but are to represent a neutral temporal scale, typically instantiated as 500-year intervals. However, as @østmo1987 and @mikkelsen1987 note in their comments to Bjerck's original paper, this purpose is already fulfilled by the calendar. If the stratigraphic information related to a specific time-interval is removed from the geological chronozone, only \'chrono\' remains. Similarly, if the archaeological chronozone is not meant to hold any culturally responsive component, only the time-scale remains. 

As a culturally independent scale, the calendar scale will always be preferable to the that of chronozones. Not only because it is firmly established, but also because it already allows for more variation in the temporal resolution associated with different phenomena to be systematised, and allows for their duration and uncertainty of occurrence to span a wider range of aggregative time-units [cf. @reitan2022, 187]. The ability to shift and readjust the temporal resolution depending on the phenomena one is attempting to align and contrast is important as ‘different timescales bring into focus different sorts of processes, requiring different concepts and different sorts of explanatory variables’ [@bailey1987, 7; @bailey2007].

In replying to this critique, @bjerck1987[40] states that questioning the need of chronozones when we already have the calendar is like asking \'Do we need the term "month" when we have numbered days?\'. This would seem to imply that chronozones, like the month, is to be of a predefined duration, at least within any individual study, and that variable duration and temporal uncertainty of phenomena to be analysed has to be collapsed into these aggregative units. Another question is also if the terminology used with chronozones is better than simply stating what time-intervals we are dealing with. For example, @bjerck2008 uses the term Middle Mesolithic (MM) to denote the three chronozones MM1, 8000--7500 BCE; MM2, 7500--7000 BCE; and MM3, 7000--6500 BCE. A reader coming across \'MM3\' instead of \'7000-6500 BCE\' therefore has to keep in mind that this simply refers to this specific time-interval. The term Middle Mesolithic should be entirely disregarded, as it is in this use meant to be devoid of any cultural meaning. One could perhaps change terminology to something that doesn't have as many cultural and research historical connotations as the Middle Mesolithic, but it strikes me as altogether unnecessary to do this via the chronozone, as this is simply solved by establishing a reference frame only using the calendar scale in the first place. If one wants to use a time-scale of 500-year intervals it would in my mind be better to simply define this independently of the now inflated discussion of chronozones, not least because I believe the discussions of the concept demonstrates that its use can lead to unnecessary confusion -- if not for practitioners, then likely for readers.

In their comments to the original paper by @bjerck1986, @østmo1987 and @mikkelsen1987 deem chronozones an unnecessary and complicating concept. Commenting on these critiques, @nyland2016[53--56] states that both of the authors make their comments in light of typological frameworks for Mesolithic south-eastern Norway, but that neither address the issue of the geographical coverage that these have. However, this is first and foremost an empirical issue rather than something to be solved by new terminology, and clearly not by the chronozone, which is a concept meant to be culturally unresponsive. 

Drawing on an example given by @nyland2016[55]; if the question is if central Norway falls within the same cultural sphere as south-eastern Norway, understood to be determined by comparable material culture, then this is dependent on two dimensions, assuming the problem of the initial delineation of these two regions has been resolved. The first is an evaluation of the degree to which characteristics of archaeological material in the two regions is considered to be similar, according some criteria. The second pertains to the timing of the occurrence of this material. To establish this necessarily demands temporal data that is independent of the typological framework itself, or possibly by reference to some principle of seriation with the uncertainty that this entails [e.g. @dunnell1970]. If a set of artefact types occurs in both central Norway and south-eastern Norway, this could lead one to suggest that a similar kind of cultural expression is common to the two regions. If independent temporal data associated with this material, such as radiocarbon dates, additionally indicates that there is a temporal synchroneity between their occurrence, then this would lead one to conclude that this cultural expression appears to occur simultaneously -- within some level of temporal certainty. Depending on the magnitude of artefactual and temporal evidence for this coincidence, this could then lead one to apply this typological framework as a dating method in the case that one excavates a site in either region and discover material of the type in question. A continuous adjustment and evaluation of the reliability of the identified cultural affinity and the derived typological dating frame will of course be necessary, but will have to be founded on material culture and the position of their occurrence on the calendar scale. This also pertains to the co-occurrence of various archaeological evidence and their wider cultural implications, for example whether or not some artefact type tends to be associated with agricultural activity. If either region lack artefactual or temporal data, then either the nature or the timing of cultural affinity cannot be resolved. The concept of chronozones cannot overcome these issues, and, I think, is more likely to confuse them. 

In conclusion, I therefore agree with @østmo1987 and @mikkelsen1987 in that the concept of chronozones represents an unnecessary complication. Although some of these complications follow from misunderstandings of the original proposition [as pointed out by @bjerck1987, 40; @nyland2016, 55], it nonetheless appears to sometimes lead to the muddling of several spatial, temporal and culturally taxonomic issues. These are therefore arguably best handled by reference to already well-established terminology, and by the use of modern methods that allows for the formal definition and handling of fuzzy and uncertain categorisation in the aggregation of data, both on the scale of material culture, time and space [e.g. @bayliss2007; @crema2012; @fusco2020; @bevan2021; @shennan2015].

The amount of ink now spent discussing chronozones also means that invoking archaeological chronozones carries with it the necessity to clarify how one intends to use it, which can be circumvented by avoiding the term altogether. Furthermore, as a term suggested for use in Pan-Scandinavian Mesolithic research, I believe this idiosyncratic terminology will also unnecessarily divorce the field from discussions of the same issues within archaeology more widely, while also making the field less accessible to outsiders, more difficult to couple with adjacent disciplines, and possibly lead to confusion with the geological chronozone. It is therefore unclear what the concept now provides beyond what well-established archaeological and colloquial terminology already covers, perhaps apart from making us aware of these universal archaeological issues.  

### Radiometric and archaeological dating methods

Rather than being based on predefined discrete time-intervals beyond the calendar scale, the analyses undertaken in the papers for this thesis largely rely on absolute dates from radiocarbon- and shoreline dating. These two methods can be denoted radiometric and archaeological dating methods, where the first category is based on a process of radioactive decay and the second is based on some regularity in human behaviour leading to predictable variation over time. In the case of shoreline dating, this follows from the proclivity of people to have continuously settled close to the shoreline throughout the Norwegian Mesolithic, where the coupling of this with the calendar scale follows from the timing of shifts in the relative sea-level. However, a note should also be made on the fact that radiometric dating is never purely based on a steady process of radioactive decay. Apart from interpretations to do with the calibration, reliability and sampling context of for example a ^14^C-date, this also has to be seen in light of other chronological information and the wider archaeological context [@wylie2017]. As with the process of shoreline displacement, the cessation of radiocarbon uptake in an organism also requires an interpretative step to be meaningfully associated with a cultural event of archaeological interest. 

It is important to underscore that given the scarcity of radiocarbon dates, and the relative low resolution of shoreline dates, typological frameworks responsive to variation in material culture can most decidedly offer valuable chronological insights, even though this is not directly integrated in the studies undertaken for this thesis. Furthermore, while the analyses are done here using dating methods that largely operate irrespective of archaeological periodisation, the results are frequently narratively and informally associated with general cultural developments believed to characterise the Stone Age of south-eastern Norway, as roughly outlined in Chapter 2. This is predominately done in an approximate manner with reference to what are best viewed as temporally and spatially fuzzy frameworks, and is based on the underlying logic that frequent co-occurrence of a range of material expressions in time and space, as suggested by others, reflects some level of meaningful cultural cohesion. This also means that the term culture is used in a loose archaeological sense and is not presumed to equate to a people or a unified unit in terms of language, genetics, or social structures [see e.g. @roberts2011 for a thorough discussion of the culture term as used in archaeology]. While it appears reasonable to assume that such cohesion has largely resulted from the same cultural factors within the geographically limited area of south-eastern Norway through the Mesolithic, it is also worth noting that empirical correspondence can be driven by other factors. This includes cases where people have arrived at the same technology in disjoint regions of time and space, known as convergence, as well as cases where the same technological expression has occurred across a range of different cultural and environmental settings [which for example has been argued to be the case with slotted bone tool technology in Northern Europe, @manninen2021] -- effectively an example of equifinality.

## Hunter-fisher-gatherers

Hunter-gatherers or foragers are useful but fuzzy and not unproblematic synonyms that are typically, but not exclusively, used to denote societies that have a diet based on non-agricultural produce [@kelly2013]. One implication of this defining characteristic appears to be a case where environmental variation represents a considerable constraining back-drop against which cultural variation can occur. As these dimension can have a fundamental impact on the economic basis of these societies, environmental variability has been frequently shown to impact central aspects of forager societies, such as population dynamics and mobility patterns, which in turn are interrelated with virtually all dimensions of these societies [e.g. @kelly2013; @morgan2009; @bird2008; @hoebe2023; @ordonez2022].

However, while it appears to be the case that variables such as temperature and precipitation dictate general variability among prehistoric and historic hunter-gatherers, this has to be severely qualified. First of all, while this appears to be the case *in general*, it can hardly be assumed to apply to any individual case [@johnson2014]. Secondly, understanding precisely what consequences variation in any single environmental variable has in any given case, if any, will be severely complicated by both the societal and environmental systemic wholes that respond to this variation, with some systems being more or less robust to such perturbations, depending also on the time-scale over which it operates and can be recognised archaeologically. While for example drought could intuitively be taken to represent a societal challenge, this certainly need not be the case. Drought might very well present more opportunities for resource exploitation than it eliminates [@arponen2019, 5--6 with further references], illustrating the point that any systemic variation, environmental or societal, can represent both threat and opportunity to systemic wholes, and simultaneously represent threat and opportunity to different parts of the system. 

What role environmental variability has for hunter-gatherer societies is also likely to be impacted by research-historical trends and. This is 

The further delineation of this thesis to focus on coastal societies has some further implications for what ethnographic data can be reasonably drawn on, and some of the implications this can be expected to have for the structure of the societies in questions. First of all, the exploitation of marine resources is found to, in general, have been associated with a higher net productivity. The term \'fishers\' is included the header for this section to underscore this coastal setting and underline the likely role fish played for these societies. However, while marine resources can reasonably be assumed to have made up a large of the diet of these societies, this  likely to a varying degree involved the catching of fish.

As representing a considerable stage in the human adaptation to diverse environments, marine habitats are deemed an essential component in the evolution of modern humans and determining for the spread of the species across the globe. In Palaeolithic archaeology, the coast has traditionally been seen as a hostile environment for early hominins -- a challenge to be overcome. Marine habitats and resource-use has also been characterised as a central for the evolution and 

A note should be made on the fact that in the literature the terms *coastal adaptation* and *coastal resource use* are sometimes taken to imply different and quite specific things [see e.g. @faulkner2021; @marean2014; @will2019]. Coastal resource use is in this understanding seen as something that is conducted sporadically or occasionally, and that has limited transformative feedback effects on the life-ways of the societies in question. Conversely, coastal adaptation involves a degree of coastal engagement and commitment that has an altering effect on these societies. I do not use the terms in this manner here. The conceptual distinction is certainly an important one, especially as marine exploitation is believed to potentially, but not necessarily [e.g. @erlandson2001], lead to technological ratcheting and increased societal complexity. However, these quite specific connotations of the terms stand in danger of leading to misunderstandings for readers that have another understanding of adaptation, which need not be defined by some threshold in the intensity of coastal engagement. One response to the specifics of a given marine habitat might for example be movement and extended use of terrestrial resources, which would fall within a more inclusive definition of adaptation to a given coastal environment. While the above division might have merit in some analytical settings, the dependence on marine resources is arguably better understood along a continuum that I believe this distinction might unnecessarily dichotomise. 

Further underlying issues with employing the hunter-gatherer society as a heuristic category with which to approach the material are ways in which the history of research into such societies might dictate . For example, a socio-evolutionary perspective was a fundamental influence at the inception of the research into hunter-gatherers. While such views are deemed a grossly inappropriate reference frame today, it can be difficult to fully grasp and account for ways in which this influences the fundamental categories we operate with, however divorced they may appear. Related concerns have also been voiced in Norwegian Mesolithic research, where for example @åstveit2014 is vary that a view of EM societies as highly mobile and LM societies as more sedentary might, at least in part, follow from an implicit view of prehistory as a continuous trajectory towards increased societal complexity. This implicit view might have forced us to cast the material traces available to us in  Calls for more directed attempts at unveiling how such research-historical conditions might influence how we conduct Mesolithic research have recently been voiced [@elliott2022; @elliott2023], and questions such as . 

While it is beyond the scope of this thesis to contribute much in the way of bringing these influences and their consequences to light, the next chapter will outline a framework that is employed in an attempt to clarify the evidential logic that underlies the undertaken studies. Hopefully, this can contribute to making evident where such biases might have influenced analytical choices and the drawn conclusions. 

\'sticking to the data\' [@longino1999, 218] is not an, but rather that conceiving of archaeological research as a social undertaking by entire research communities has implications for how this is best done, and can be drawn on to facilitate feedback from and 

## Palaeodemography
Palaeodemography or the study of temporal and spatial variation in the size and structure of past populations is a fundamental problem for archaeology [e.g. @shennan2000; @kintigh2014; @french2021]. This follows from the fact that demography is a determining factor in processes such as genetic diversification, social network structure and scaling, technological innovation and accumulation, as well as. As human culture is in large part determined by human interaction, 

One Known as the forager paradox. [@french2021, 4]
One of the implications of these findings is that the interpretation of archaeological proxies for population size is not as straightforward as one might immediately think. This in turn, needs to be kept in mind both when devising and comparing multiple population proxies, and in the construction of the narrative that builds on any numerical results.

Demographic modelling in early Holocene Fennoscandia has taken on a few different. In most recent years this is the SPD approach [@solheim2018; @solheim2020; @nielsen20; @jorgensen2020]. The SPD approach is based on summing the probability distribution associated with ^14^C-dates. However, there are a series of methodological and conceptual issues with this procedure, some of which have been dealt with and others which are integrated into the methodology and needs to be accounted for when interpreting any results.  

Preconceived notions of what has characterised hunter-fisher-gatherer societies will at some level necessarily impact how the material under study is interrogated. This follows both from what research questions are deemed central, and because these notions will have impacted how the material has been retrieved and recorded. These notions are therefore to some degree inescapable influences on any research into the Norwegian Mesolithic. However, in the next chapter I will argue how this does not, and should not, lead to epistemic despair.
