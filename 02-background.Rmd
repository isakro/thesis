# Background
This chapter presents the context of the study


## Environmental setting

The environmental setting for the Mesolithic in Scandinavia is first and foremost defined by the end of the Weichselian and the retreat of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet [see @skar2018; @skar2022:106--109]. Most pronounced of the resulting environmental impacts is the melting of the ice sheet itself, corresponding eustatic sea-level change and isostatic rebound, as well as the developments of the Baltic Sea which transitioned between being open and closed off from. These developments form a  backdrop to which human societies developed. 

The global climate reconstructions based on oxygen isotopes from the Greenland ice cores  gradual heating interspersed with cold events c. 10 300 cal BP, c. 9200 cal BP and 8200 cal BP. However, how these events played out locally and what consequences this development had for local ecosystems and human populations appears to vary quite dramatically across Northern Europe and thus cannot be assumed a priori to have been of relevance or concern for the societies dealt with in this thesis. 

### Climactic oscilations


Regional increase in temperature and perticipation rates from the early Preboreal, followed by mild winters and humid conditions in the Boreal with the Holocene Thermal Maximum, locally dated to c. 6400--2400 BCE.  

At the transition to the Boreal, the vegetation in the region goes from arctic vegetation characterised by to  

### Sea-level change
Depending on scale of, sea-level change can impact not only the habitational suitability of any individual location, but can have far-reaching effects that impact shoreline morphology, drainage systems [e.g. @gross2018; @astrup2018]. While the at times dramatic magnitude of these changes would have required a response from human populations inhabiting impacted areas, it is by no means given that these represent negative consequences for these societies. In fact, areas impacted by sea-level change can be attractive for hunting, fishing and gathering precisely because of these factors. The study of human response to sea-level change should therefore not assume that this would be the result of. How sea-level change impacts any given area will thus depend on a wide range of factors pertaining to the amplitude of shoreline displacement, the topographic setting, and the nature of societal systems which respond to these changes.

## Chronological framework

The traditional typo-chronological framework for the Mesolithic in south-eastern Norway can in large part be ascribed @mikkelsen1975, and later adjustments by. Before Mikkelsen, the Mesolithic was divided into a Fosna and a Nøstvet-phase, the latter of which was also believed to be concurrent with the.  
The traditional chronological framework for the Mesolithic of south-eastern Norway has followed along the general lines of that presented by @glørstad2010[23, see table]. Recently this has been. The degree to which the chronological shifts are. While they form a natural frame for the narrative structure of this text, these should not been seen as the impact of strict periodisation is to some extent counteracted by treating. This will be treated in more detail in the next chapter 

In a comprehensive reassessment that also includes results from the last decades of excavations, @reitan2022 has recently suggested a new chronological framework for the Mesolithic period in south-eastern Norway [also @reitan2016]. As his focus has mainly been on technological and typo-chronologcal developments, and given their recent date of publication, this chronological framework has yet to be comprehensively evualuated in terms of correspondence with other societal developments. The presentation of major chronological trends in the sections below thus follows the traditional periodisation. However, in the discussion chapter, the results of this thesis will also be seen in relation to the framwework suggested by Reitan.

The following sections will outline general societal developments believed to characterise the Norwegian Mesolithic, divided into the periods Early Mesolithic (EM; 9300--8300 BCE), Middle Mesolithic (MM; ) and Late Mesolithc (LM; . While focus is on south-eastern Norway, reference to a wider context and neighbouring regions in Norway and Sweden when perspectives 

### The Early Mesolithic (9300--8300 BCE)

The first human presence in Norway is recorded from around 9300 BCE, which marks the start of the EM. A central discussion has concerned whether people first migrated into the area of present-day Norway from a route along the coast of Western Sweden, from the north-east along the North Norwegian coast, or across the Norwegian trench to south-western Norway from the the North Sea Plain (Doggerbank). Most recent evidence suggest that a crossing from Doggerbank would not have been feasible due to the distances involved [@glorstad2016; @glorstad2017]. The present consensus is therefore that the earliest human dispersal into present-day Norway is likely to have originated on the coast of western Sweden around 9500--9300 BCE [e.g. @glorstad2020; @bjerck2008]. From here, people are believed to have rapidly extended along most of the Norwegian coastline, while a north-eastern migration reached Kola and northern Norway some time before 9000 BCE [@manninen2021]. These two routes are associated with the genetically defined 'western' hunter gatherers that migrated from the south, and 'eastern' hunter-gatherers migrating from the north [@gunther2018], each identifiable also in terms of distinct material culture and technological traits [@manninen2021].

 (f.eks. Bjerck 2008c:74; Glørstad 2010a:91-93)

Pioneer sites in in Norway and Western Sweden have traditonally been ascribed the 'cultures' or 'technocomplexes' Fosna and Hensbacka, respectively. Today these are seen as representing the same phenomena [e.g. @bjerck2008, 75; @]. Fosna/Hensbacka sites consist of fairly homogenous lithic inventories, and are widely held as having a common origin in South-Scandinavian and North-European Ahrensburgian groups (e.g. @bjerck2008; @schmitt2009; @band-andersen2012; @fuglestvedt2012; @riede2014, 564]. The analyses of artefact inventories, the presence of high-quality South Scandinavian flint, and the chronological support of radiocarbon dates and shoreline dates have in sum led to the relative consensus on this continental connection (see Fischer 1996; Schmitt et al. 2006; Fuglestvedt 2007; Bang-Andersen 2012; Glørstad 2016). Furthermore, the similarities has led @fuglestvedt2012[8]  to propose that the terms Fosna/Hensbacka be abandoned altogether, in favour of Ahrensburg, as this would accentuate the continental elements that appear so defining for these pioneer sites. Although this has been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm (e.g. Åstveit 2014 with comments), particularly by those emphasising the strong marine orientation of the Fosna/Hensbacka, there has also been the occasional use of variations such as 'coastal Ahrensburg' to denote the Fosna/Hensbacka (Prøsch-Danielsen & Høgestøl 1995). At any rate, these discussions do go to show that the similarities between Fosna/Hensbacka and Ahrensburg are substantial and that there is a clear affinity with European hunter-gatherers.



This first human migration from continental Europe is by many argued to show a clear affinity with European hunter-gatherers, also leading to the suggestion that these societies should be termed Ahrensburgian also in Norway, to underscore this European connection. While this terminology has been met with variable degrees of enthusiasm, the connection to continental Europe is nonetheless clear. 

Coupled to this discussion is also what motivated the initial human dispersion into these territories. 

The blade technology of the Early Mesolithic is based on single- and dual-platform one-sided cores, typically by means of direct percussion [@solheim2020].  

Some central discussion that linger in the literature concerned with the period pertains to the nature of the first colonisation of Norway. Did the coastal areas represent an unprecedented opportunity in an extended Garden of Eden, or an obstacle to be overcome for adven. Furthermore, discussions pertaining to the degree of mobility and unified nature of lithic assemblages 


### The Middle Mesolithic (8300--5600 BCE)
While the Middle Mesolithic (MM) was defined as a seperate typo-chronological phase in the 1970s, Bjerck stated as late as 2008 that the period was associated with a limited archaeological material, thus posing a challenge for interpretations of the period  [@bjerck2008, 92--98]. This is in part related to sea-level transgressions in this period along the coast of southern and western Norway. However, investigations in recent years have dramatically changed this picture, not least in eastern Norway, which has not been subject sea-level transgressions at any point. 

@bjerkc2008, notes that period is characterised by a degree of regionalisation that is not evident in the EM material. 

In the Middle Mesolithic blades are produced from conical and sub-conical cores with a single platform using pressure and indirect percussion [@damlien2016; @solheim2020].

### The Late Mesolithic (5600--3900 BCE)

Blade production in the Late Mesolithic is characterised by the introduction of handle cores [@eigeland2015]. As pointed out by @solheim2020[4], this involves a shift from cores that will result in blades of gradually diminishing size as the core is exhausted in the EM and MM, to cores that result in blades of a uniform and comparatively small size (i.e. microblades). 

## Coastal hunter-gatherers
As representing adaptation to diverse environments, marine habitats are deemed an essential component in the evolution of modern humans and determining for the spread of the species across the globe. In Palaeolithic archaeology the coast has traditionally been seen as a hostile environment for early hominins. Marine habitats and resource-use has also been characterised as a central for the evolution and 

A note should be made on the fact that in the literature the terms *coastal adaptation* and *coastal resource use* are sometimes taken to imply different and quite specific things [see e.g. @faulkner2021; @marean2014; @will2019]. Coastal resource use is in this understanding seen as something that is conducted sporadically or occasionally, and will have limited transformative feedback effects on the life-ways of the societies in question. Conversely, coastal adaptation involves a degree of coastal engagement and commitment that has an altering effect on these societies. I do not use the terms in this manner here. The conceptual distinction is certainly an important one, especially as marine exploitation is believed to potentially, but not necessarily [e.g. @erlandson2001], lead to technological ratcheting and increased societal complexity. However, these quite specific connotations of the terms stand in danger of leading to misunderstandings for readers that have another understanding of adaptation, which need not be defined by some threshold in the intensity of coastal engagement. One response to the specifics of a given marine habitat might for example be movement and extended use of terrestrial resources, which would fall within a more inclusive definition of adaptation to a given coastal environment. While the above division might have merit in some analytical settings, the dependence on marine resources is arguably better understood along a continuum that I believe this might unnecessarily dichotomise.
