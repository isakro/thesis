# Introduction

One way to conceive of scientific inquiry is as a form of strategy by which we try to confront theoretical constructs with empirical observation, aimed at aligning our beliefs as reliably as possible with what is true [@godfrey-smith2003, 161]. A lot remains to be unpacked from this sentence. However, for now it is enough to note that the empirical side of this equation is a critical point for archaeology, as the fragmented and uncertain nature of the archaeological record means that there will always be a multitude of possible explanations that could account for any observed empirical pattern. Reducing this number of candidate explanations is first and foremost dependent on data, which in the case of archaeology are scarce. 

Establishing true explanations of a past social reality is at best exceedingly difficult, perhaps impossible, and must be the result of cumulative and recursive efforts from entire research communities over time -- it is not achieved by individual researchers. Accepting this social and cumulative nature of archaeological inquiry means that one can adopt a strategy to try to make one's research as open and amenable to scrutiny, extension, criticism and alternative approaches as possible. While easier said than done, an attempt at adopting such a strategy is done here. 

To accommodate the above points, this thesis aims to stringently explore and contrast empirical trends that have been deemed of importance for understanding past hunter-fisher-gatherer societies, drawing on the extensive material from the coastal Mesolithic of south-eastern Norway. Based on this, the project aims to culminate with the generation and presentation of some hypotheses concerning possible casual drivers behind the observed patterns. Exploration and stringency are explicitly voiced here for a couple of reasons. Exploration concerns an aspiration to approach the material with a degree of secession from previous hypotheses concerning the societal developments in the period, and to instead have observed empirical trends dictate the hypotheses presented. This can facilitate a freer investigation, transformation and combination of empirical patterns, as it reduces the risk of forcing the treatment of empirical patterns, consciously or not, towards a single explanation or end-goal. However, a complete break with previous beliefs is clearly neither possible nor desirable. For one these will in part have dictated how the material under study has been retrieved and recorded, how I will approach it, and is necessary for it to be possible to contextualise and make sense of any observed patterns. Stringency, and with it transparency of the analytical choices made, will make it easier for both me and others to follow the logic of the arguments presented, and make it easier to identify when and in what ways prior beliefs might have led an interpretation astray.   

As in many other areas of the world, the last few decades have seen a dramatic increase in the material generated by Norwegian archaeology. In terms of sheer number of sites and associated data, this is most marked for the coastal Stone Age material [e.g. @bergsvik2020; @damlien2021]. Given that this increase in material is achieved on the back of public spending, it is arguably a disciplinary obligation to utilise this data for research purposes. While there are many possible arguments for why archaeology is worthwhile at all, some more vague than others, the economic burden of archaeological practice is clearly easier to justify if the data we generate also informs the research we do. However, getting even a basic overview of this now vast material necessitates the use of quantitative and computational methods designed to handle, describe, explore, present, summarise and infer from such quantities of data. Following some early optimism in the 60s and 70s, such methods have, until recently, seen sporadic and relatively limited application for research purposes in Norwegian archaeology. 

Quantification offers standardisation and simplification, and by extension scalability and comparability. As with all disciplines concerned with the complexity of social life, whether past or present, archaeology also benefits from multiple perspectives that move between the nuance of particularities and the general trends illuminated by aggregated analysis. I would argue that the latter is at present still underdeveloped in Norwegian archaeology. With renewed and ongoing enthusiasm for such approaches, it is important that this is combined with a continually critical view of the answers these approaches can provide, and those which they cannot.

One of the great disciplinary benefits of archaeology, as compared to other disciplines concerned with the study of human societies, is by many argued to follow from the time depth it offers [e.g. @gamble2014]. Furthermore, while there are instances where the archaeological record allows what could be called glimpses into an ethnographic past of individual lives, the vast majority of the material we have access to is hampered by a degree of temporal uncertainty and lumping of events that necessitates a perspective that is developed to meet the nature and quality of the archaeological record on its own terms [@bailey2007; @perreault2019]. Both fully utilising the archaeological material and playing to the strengths of the discipline is thus dependent on knowledge of the quality of the material available to us, while also being dependent on developing methodologies fit for handling the material, given the empirical resolution it holds.

## Aims and research questions

The overarching goal of this thesis is to contribute to answering the following:

i) What characterises the extent and quality of the archaeological record from Mesolithic Norway? 
ii) What consequences for our disciplinary agenda and potential for understanding the Norwegian Mesolithic does this hold?  

The answer to these questions is a disciplinary-wide undertaking, and no single thesis can hope to arrive at a final answer. However, to contribute to their elucidation, the thesis is centred on three more specific research questions, derived from these overarching goals. The first of these can be viewed as largely instrumental in that it pertains to the degree and certainty with which we can fix the occurrence of our data on the calendar scale:

1) What chronological control do we have of the occupation of coastal Stone Age sites within the study area?

As @vankilde has put it: \'Chronology is the backbone of social interpretation\'. Following from an answer to this first question, the following two questions can therefore be explored:

2) What general patterns characterises the lithic inventories of the sites over time?
3) How is the frequency of sites distributed across time?

These latter questions have direct substantive implications, as their answer can be expected to be directly related to cultural developments. It should be noted that these are stated in an open and exploratory manner. What patterns are explored in the lithic assemblages and how any variation in the frequency of sites over time is interpreted in substantive terms are not done following some pre-defined framework but is rather approached in an inductive and exploratory manner.

## Study area

The study area of this thesis is delineated to coastal south-eastern Norway. No strict cultural-historical demarcation to surrounding regions is assumed, nor does that appear to be a have been the case throughout the Mesolithic. 

Furthermore, what is termed the coastal Mesolithic naturally didn't exist in isolation from inland regions. While the Mesolithic sites in Norway are concentrated to the coast [e.g. @bjerck2008], the reason behind the geographical limiting of the study is mainly analytical. First, while Mesolithic data is available from a wider region of south-eastern Norway, including inland areas, the last few decades have seen an virtual explosion of investigations in the coastal region between Horten municipality in the north east to Arendal in the south west. This has also been accompanied by geological studies to map the dramatic sea-level change that has impacted the Norwegian coast through the Holocene. The region thus represents an archaeologically well-sampled area where we also have good control of the trajectory of shoreline displacement. While the relevance of the findings in the study can be assumed to have relevance for surrounding areas, this subsection of south-eastern Norway therefore limits the spatial extent of the considered data. Furthermore, while this region holds high-quality archaeological material, investigated and recorded using modern methods, there is also an abundance of legacy data from the region, especially in the form of comparatively low-resolution and low-quality survey data. This constrained region thus also offers an excellent case-study for exploring the implications of dealing with data of wildly varying quality.   

Finally, methods and approaches developed for the coastal sites are not necessarily directly transferable to inland areas. This pertains most clearly to the concept of shoreline dating, which is based on dating sites with reference to their present altitude and the relative sea-level fall that characterises the region (see Paper 1). This offers a degree of large scale temporal control that is independent of the preservation of organic material for ^14^C-dates that is unique to the coast.

## Model-based archaeology
Moving on from establishing a firmer grasp on the temporal dimension of the archaeological record in the two first papers, the final two papers of the thesis are more directly aimed at elucidating past cultural historical dimensions by tracking developments in empirical trends that have been linked to the understanding of past hunter-gatherer societies. This will be done within a framework of model-based archaeology. Models can be seen as partially independent representations of theory and data [@morrison1999]. By being a concrete realisation of an abstract theory in which its claims and conditions holds true, the model allows for a transfer of the logic of the theory to the modelled data, and a subsequent evaluation and manipulation of the fit between the two. Models are thus both descriptive and analytical, and can be seen as mechanisms or mediators allowing for the coupling of the two dimensions [e.g. @clarke1972; @kohler2007; @lake2015]. The inferential modesty called for above follows from the defining characteristic that \'All models are wrong, but some are useful\', as @box1979[202] famously put it. 

@barton2013 proposes a conscious and explicit modelling practice in archaeology for the same reasons. Traditionally, archaeological explanation is based on inductive and informal construction of narratives based on the inferential strategy of including as much data as possible and then arriving at a single explanation that is perceived to be the best fit in a *post-hoc* manner. This is argued to have a tendency to result in explanatory complacency and high personal investment into the credibility of any given explanation. By embracing the explicit uncertainty and fallibility that is a defining part of model-based approaches, this will therefore increase disciplinary progress, as it will lower the threshold for probing, adjusting and discarding one’s own models. 

## The hunter-gatherer model and the coastal Mesolithic of south-eastern Norway
The concept of hunter-fisher-gatherers will function as a foundational model from which to derive empirical avenues to be explored, and to propose possible causal drivers behind any observed patterns [cf. @warren2022, 29]. An example of a source from where this will be derived is the seminal work *The Lifeways of Hunter-Gatherers: The Foraging Spectrum* [@kelly2013]. In the introduction of the book, @kelly2013[4] states that it is aimed at providing its readers with \'some knowledge of the variation that exist among foragers and some idea of what accounts for it\'. Thus, while comprehensive in scope, @kelly2013 is also very explicit in the limitations of his review and cautions against. The societal variation among more recent hunter-gatherer societies is immense, and as foraging has constituted the predominant life-way for humanity for as much as, the variation that can be expected among past hunter-gatherer societies is comparatively vast [@singh2022]. Consequently, this thesis attempts to balance insights from hunter-fisher-gatherer studies more widely with an open and exploratory perspective. While preconceptions of hunter-fisher-gatherer societies necessarily dictates some of the analytical avenues taken and influence the type of questions that are asked, the aim is to have idiosyncrasies of the archaeological record in the context of coastal south-eastern Norway dictate the conclusions that are reached.

Another challenge in determining what empirical trends are of interest and how these are to be understood follow from the explicitly coastal setting of the study. Historically, both work on world prehistory and ethnography has focused on terrestrial contexts [e.g. @bailey2004; @yesner1980]. This issue also extends to the methodological realm, where for example the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in archaeology has predominantly been used in terrestrial contexts [see e.g. @conolly2006]. This is especially pertinent for the study of the coastal Mesolithic of Scandinavia, which is characterised by dramatic sea-level change throughout the period [e.g. @bjerck2008; @astrup2018]. Out-of-the-box procedures are therefore not necessarily directly applicable and have to be adjusted to meet the demands of a geologically dynamic coastal context. 

## Open research and reproducibility

In making the case for open sharing practices in archaeological research, @marwick2017[426] compares the principle of artefact provenancing with dissemination of raw data and methods that underlie a study. Without knowing the origin and find-context of an artefact, it's archaeological value is practically none. Comparatively, by openly sharing data and programming code that underlies a study, other researchers can assess the procedures that have led to the results. Apart from facilitating an evaluation of its reliability, this allows others to extend on the analysis and the employed data, to learn and reconstruct how methods are implemented, and to attempt to repeat all or parts of the analysis themselves. Open research is thus beneficial to archaeology as a cumulative research endeavour as it will both increase the frequency of model rejection and adjustment, by allowing others to explore their foundations and inner workings, and because it will increase the pace of method sharing, evaluation and adjustment.  

This thesis has been written in its entirety using the R programming language [@rcoreteam2021]. Unlike for example mouse-driven computational analyses, this means that an unambiguous record of the entire analytical pipeline is recorded in the form of programming scripts, moving from the initial loading and cleaning of raw data, through to analysis, visualisation and final reporting of results. Given the large amount of analytical choices that have to made in the course of any analysis, this can never be adequately presented in prose. Furthermore, what a researcher believes they have done need not correspond with what they have actually done. The high-resolution analytical record that is the programming script makes this entirely transparent. All data, programming code, figures and text used in this thesis is freely available in version-controlled online repositories on GitHub (https://github.com/isakro) and on persistent archiving services where the repository is provided a digital object identifier (DOI).

## Overview of papers
### Paper 1: *A simulation-based assessment of the relation between Stone Age sites and relative sea-level change along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast*
The first paper of the thesis offers an approach for integrating the various sources of uncertainty associated with reconstructing the relationship between ^14^C-dated archaeological phenomena and past sea-level change. This is used to quantify the distance between Stone Age sites and the prehistoric shoreline within the study area. That coastal sites would have been located on or close to the prehistoric shoreline is a fundamental premise in Norwegian Stone Age archaeology. In combination with reconstructions of past shoreline displacement, this is frequently used to date the sites based on their altitude relative to the present day sea-level---a method known as shoreline dating. The findings of the paper largely reflect the development proposed in the literature, with a predominantly shorebound coastal settlement in the Mesolithic, followed by a few sites being located some distance from the shoreline at the transition to the Early Neolithic (c. 3900 BCE) and a more decisive shift with the Late Neolithic (c. 2400 BCE). The result of this analysis is used to propose a formalised method for shoreline dating sites older than the Late Neolithic. This takes into account uncertainty as related to the displacement of the shoreline and the likely distance between sites and the shoreline when they were occupied. 

### Paper 2: *shoredate: An R package for shoreline dating Stone Age sites on the coast of south-eastern Norway*
Based on the findings from the first paper, the second paper of the thesis is a presentation of the R package *shoredate*, which provides tools for performing and handling shoreline dates along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. This is freely available for anyone to install from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.r-project.org/package=shoredate. The paper itself gives a brief presentation of the package, but the publication of software with the *Journal of Open Source Software* also involves a useful review process of the software itself. Having published the package and released it as open source software on CRAN means that the method for shoreline dating is now available for researchers and student to employ, and that underlying code is available for anyone to explore, evaluate, criticise or extend upon. 

### Paper 3: *Exploring the composition of lithic assemblages in Mesolithic south-eastern Norway*
The second part of the thesis is aimed more squarely on elucidating past cultural history, as opposed to the more instrumental focus of the first part on establishing tools for . The third paper of the thesis is an exploratory study aimed at identifying variability in the contents of a set of lithic assemblages. The main goals of the paper is to evaluate the typo-technological framework currently in use in Norwegian Mesolithic research, and to assess the temporal development for variables that have been linked to variation in land-use and mobility patterns. It is demonstrated that elements of the so-called Whole Assemblage Behavioural Indicators [WABI, e.g. @clark2017] align with previous research into developments of mobility patterns in Mesolithic Norway, suggesting that the WABI could be a relevant framework also in this context. This is specifically reflected in a negative relationship between density of lithics, and the proportion of secondarily worked lithics in the assemblages over time, which is taken to reflect a transition from a more curated towards a expedient technological organisation with the transition from the Early Mesolithic (c. 8200 BCE). This is in turn argued to follow from a shift in land-use patterns and a overall reduction in mobility.

### Paper 4: *Comparing summed probability distributions of shoreline- and radiocarbon dates on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast*
Unpacking the complex interplay between environmental conditions, settlement patterns and population density has been deemed of fundamental importance to archaeological inquiry [e.g. @shennan2000; @french2016]. The fourth and final paper of the thesis is aimed at combining findings from the previous papers to evaluate the interplay between some empirical indicators suggested in the literature to be related to these dimensions. Concretely, the paper aims at elucidating the relationship between variation in relative population size as potentially reflected in the density of shoreline dated sites and the intensity of radiocarbon dates over time.
