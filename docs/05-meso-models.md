# Modelling the Norwegian Mesolithic

The last chapter laid out the foundation for what can constitute components of a model-based archaeology. This chapter will explore some ways in which casting the papers of the thesis in this light can help elucidate assumptions and further lines of inquiry associated with the arguments and empirical patterns identified in the papers. The central empirical patterns identified for the papers are presented in Figure. 



First, the evidential foundations and inferential leaps that underlie the archaeological claims made in the papers are explicated by presenting each paper using an evidential argument schema [@chapman2016; @toulmin1958]. Subsequently, a causal model for the main components of each paper is presented in the form of directed acyclic graphs [DAGs, e.g. @morgan2015; @pearl2009]. These outline some substantive explanations that I believe might underlie the patterns that are observed in each paper, with the purpose of identifying some implications and avenues along which the results can be further interrogated in the future. First, therefore, the components of evidential argument schemas and graphical causal models are presented.     

## Evidential argument schema

In the following, the presentation of each paper starts with laying out an evidential argument schema for the central evidential claims being made in the papers. The purpose of this is to clarify the argument being made, highlight central and potential objections and uncertainties, ways in which the study account for these, and ways in which this could be further investigated and improved in future studies. The components of the argument schemas are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:argument).

\end{figure}

Following @toulmin1958, \'warrants\' are here understood as bridging concepts that allows one to move from observed data to substantive evidential claim. Warrants are in themselves claims that \'license the inference from facts to conclusions\' [@chapman2016, 34] that therefore also depend on underlying substantive, domain-specific arguments. All claims, including warrants, can in turn be challenged by \'rebuttals\', which represent potential exceptions or objections to the claims made. To maintain the inferential claim, rebuttals can in turn be answered with additional support and evidence, termed \'backing\'.

Some adjustments to this framework have been made here. First, I have added the category \'potential backing\'. These are meant to indicate steps that might be taken in future studies to further accommodate rebuttals and to further strengthen the belief that the warrants hold. Secondly, drawing on @chapman2016, the category \'deflection\' indicates cases where I argue that rebuttals can be disregarded either due to an assumed limited impact or due to the challenges involved in properly accounting for them. That is, in these cases the rebuttals are not met with additional backing. Finally, the category \'qualifiers\' from Figure \@ref(fig:dag) is not included, as there were as of yet no grounds on which to properly assess the strength of the evidential claims being made in the papers.   

In the presentation of the papers below, these schemas will not be complete, but draw on what I view as the most central components of the arguments. Further nuances and caveats can be found in prose in the papers themselves, while the data and code published with each paper also offer further sources that can be scrutinised for additional underlying assumptions and potential inconsistencies. 

## Directed acyclic graphs

The second part of the presentation of each paper involves constructing a causal graph that explicate what I believe are the main proximal causal drivers behind the patterns that were observed in each study. As was outlined conceptually in Chapter \@ref(chapter4), building comprehensive theories of what we believe underlie a data generating process is central both to meaningfully treat the data, test explanations, and offers a clear path for establishing alternative explanatory frameworks which can be compared and contrasted.

The presentation draws on what has been termed structural causal modelling, which originated with Pearl [see @pearl2009; and @pearl2018 for an accessible introduction], through the use of causal graphs in the form of directed acyclic graphs. While causal graphs have seen some use in archaeology, the more principled framework of structural causal modelling has seen limited application in archaeology and is increasingly applied in the social sciences more generally [see e.g. @elwert2013; @pearl2009; @mcelreath2020; @morgan2015; @rohrer2018; @huntington-klein2022; @greenland1999]. As the causal graphs presented here are only meant to be cautious suggestions that can potentially structure future studies and accommodate further discussion, their full potential is far from being utilised. 

First, it is necessary to establish some foundational premises and terminology. The goal of structural causal modelling is to allow the associative relationships that can be assessed by use of statistical models to inform the causal effect that exist between variables. A blind inclusion of all and as many covariates as one can come up, without taking in explicit stance towards causation, stands in danger of undermining any drawn conclusions. This follows from the fact that the complete causal web will dictate what variables will have to be controlled for, and which variables would introduce bias if they are controlled. This is demonstrated through the use of DAGs below.

DAGs represented a specific kind of causal graph, where the term \'directed\' refers to the rule that causal effects cannot be bi-directional -- that is, causes points to effects. \'Acylic\' refers to the rule that no directed path can form a closed loop. To illustrate the concept, a series of basic causal relationships are represented as DAGs in Figure \@ref(fig:dag). While many details have been left of this presentation, all DAGs, irrespective of their complexity, can be constructed and analysed using the basic relationships of chains X &rarr; Y &rarr; Z (and the condensed X &rarr; Y), forks X &larr; Z &rarr; Y, and inverted forks X &rarr; Z &larr; Y [@elwert2013, 249], all which are represented in Figure \@ref(fig:dag). 

The direction of the arrows (edges) in the model illustrates what variables (nodes) have a causal effect on other variables. An arrow going directly between two variables means that there is a direct effect. X is therefore said to have a direct causal effect on Y in Figure \@ref(fig:dag)A. In other words, X causes Y. In Figure \@ref(fig:dag)C, X has a direct effect on Y, but as Z impacts both, Z is a confounding variable. That is to say, part of the impact of X on Y may simply be the result of Z affecting both, thus distorting the causal relationship between X and Y if Z is not controlled for. In Figure \@ref(fig:dag)D, both X and Y cause Z. Z is therefore said to be a collider. Here, controlling for Z would lead to a distortion of the association between between X and Y. This is because conditioning on a common outcome of two variables will introduce spurious association between the variables, known as collider or endogenous selection bias [@elwert2013, 250]. In Figure \@ref(fig:dag)B, part of the effect of X on Y goes through Z, which is therefore said to be indirect, mediated by Z. Controlling for Z would in this case block the causal pathway and could lead to an underestimation of the magnitude of the causal effect of X on Y. While there might be situations in which it could be of interest to isolate the effect that remains after accounting for the mediating variable [@baron19886; @hayes2009], it has been demonstrated that this kind of mediation analysis stands in danger of introducing endogenous selection bias [@elwert2013, 264]. A rule of thumb is therefore to not control for mediating variables. 

Explicating the causal processes and relationships that we believe underlie our explanations is critical for the construction of study designs and statistical models that correctly account for the causal relationships between variables, as not doing so stands in danger of severely distorting our findings. Furthermore, causal modelling and the explicit formulation what mechanisms we believe underlie the data generating process is  

However, DAGs can also be used to represent associative non-causal relationships. This point is of relevance for non-causal measurement modelling, concerned with establishing how measurable indicator variables can be used to represent abstract theoretical variables, sometimes termed latent variables, which do not have a  the defintion and empirical indicators of which are not   

Central to causal graphs is that as the presence of arrows merely point to a possible causal relationship, the definitive claims of knowledge rather stems from missing arrows  

While it might seem disconcerting that DAGs cannot readily accommodate cycles or feedback-loops, which are most certainly operating in societal systems, @morgan2015[80] recommend focusing on first establishing empirically tractable directed graphs in most settings. One solution can be to take repeated measures at multiple time-points which can then be added as individual nodes in the model, such that, for example, increasing population density following an initial phase of colonisation might initially lead to a reduction in residential mobility, and reduction in residential mobility could then cause a further increase in population density at a later time-point. Thus, with increased temporal resolution, DAGs can accommodate such complex situations [@rohrer2018, 30].

DAGs are an effective tool for clarifying research questions, for explicating relevant concepts, for identifying assumptions underlying an explanation, and for deriving testable implications of a causal model. Furthermore, provided the variables can be sensibly operationalised, DAGs offer a precise statement of how the interrelation between variables should be modelled statistically or how a sampling design should be structured so as to correctly estimate causal influences while removing the effects of non-causal associations that distort these estimates.  

It is, however, important to note here that the DAGs presented below are highly speculative and have limited theoretical specification. They are presented in a purely qualitative manner, lacking information about the strength and shape of proposed causal relationships, as well as their operationalisation. Furthermore, as they represent a first iteration, they are only meant to be tenuous suggestions that can potentially pave the way for exploring these issues. This will first involve the challenging task of establishing if and how the variables can be reliably measured, which reflects the fundamental issue of measurement and how archaeological data can be cast as evidence for past events. Finally, to derive a correct assessment of causality will ultimately require all relevant variables to be included in the DAG, which is a monumental undertaking. 

 fundamental and easier-to-measure variables before incorporating more complex variables. This approach allows for a solid foundation and a better understanding of the potential causal relationships involved, before more complex relationships can be incorporated into the model. While the DAGs presented here will undoubtedly be proven to be inadequate in a myriad of ways, I still believe in the benefits of attempting to explicate our suggested explanations in this manner, as they can provide a starting point for further analysis, and for iterative refinement as our understanding grows.

## Modelling the relationship between Mesolithic sites and the prehistoric shoreline {#shoremodel}
\sectionmark{Modelling the Mesolithic site-sea relationship}

In the first paper of this thesis I have proposed a method for shoreline dating Mesolithic sites on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast, based on an empirically derived model of the relationship between the sites and the prehistoric shoreline [@roalkvam2023]. This was based on simulating the distance between sites and the shoreline using 66 ^14^C-dated sites and local reconstructions of shoreline displacement. The ^14^C-dates thus operate as evidence for site-use that is independent of the position of the shoreline at the time, effectively offering a way to test and quantify the long-held belief that coastal Stone Age sites in Norway were located by the shoreline. The study found the sites to typically be located on or close to the shoreline up until some time just after 4000 BCE, when a few sites are located further inland from the shoreline. At around 2500 BCE there is a clear break, and the sites are from this point on situated further from and at variable distances from the shoreline. Building on these findings, the likely elevation of sites dating to earlier than 2500 BCE were, in aggregate, found to be reasonably approximated by the gamma function given in Figure. This is the model that forms the foundation of the proposed method for shoreline dating, which is released as an R package with the second paper of the thesis [@roalkvam2023b].

The evidence and arguments underlying the study are presented as an argument schema in Figure \@ref(fig:t1). This centres on six major warrants that are necessary foundations for the evidential claim to hold. The first of these, Warrant 1, pertains to the radiocarbon dates from the sites and whether these correspond to the typological indicators in the lithic inventory of the sites, or should for some other reasons be disregarded as not being related to the occupation of the sites. For Paper 1, this choice was largely based on following the discretion of the archaeologists who have undertaken the excavations. Excluding these dates substantially increased the degree to which sites were found to have been located by the shoreline, and thus functions in support for the evidential claim. A potential concern could be that the fundamental premise in Norwegian Stone Age archaeology that coastal sites were situated close to the shoreline might have impacted how these dates are treated in the excavation reports. A brief presentation of the dates and the arguments for why they are believed to correspond or not to the use of each site is provided in the supplementary material to the paper (Backing 1.3). While I believe this procedure to be adequate and the interpretations in the excavation reports to generally be sensible, it might be a worthwhile improvement to instead predefine a set of evaluation criteria for the quality and relevance of the ^14^C-dates if a similar study was to be undertaken in the future [Potential backing 1.4, following e.g. @pettitt2003; @seitsonen2012]. This would reduce the number of *ad hoc* assessments of the dates.       

A related point that is not included in the schema that is worth commenting on is how several radiocarbon dates from a single site were treated. Dates not intersecting at 99.7% probability were seen as representative of unrelated occupation events. Intersecting dates were then modelled using the OxCal [v.4.4, @bronkramsey2021] function Boundary, and then summed using the Sum function. However, the procedure of summing dates is argued by some authors to be difficult to justify statistically, and procedures for defining the likely start, span and end-dates for occupational phases might be more sensible [e.g. @blackwell2003]. Furthermore, typological indicators in the assemblages could also have been included in the modelling of the dates [e.g @bronkramsey2009; @buck1996], thus potentially offering further backing to Warrant 1.

Warrant 2 pertains to the geological reconstructions of shoreline displacement and the interpolation between these to the sites. This is a necessary premise for it to be possible to evaluate the correspondence between site-use and the sea. While it appears that the geological curves can generally be considered trustworthy, there are some uncertainties associated with these that are not accounted for. This follows from the expert knowledge that underlies the curves, meaning that some variation between them could simply follow from which experts have conducted the studies. While there exist more principled methodologies for constructing such curves, which could potentially reduce or be used to assess some of this subjectivity [e.g @cahill2016], this was beyond my geological know-how and the scope of this thesis (Deflection 2.4). Furthermore, the procedure for interpolating the trajectory of shoreline displacement to locations between the isobases of the curves was done using inverse distance weighting (IDW). IDW does not account for increased uncertainty as one moves further away from the isobases, and is dependent on how the distance to the isobases is weighed and how many of the isobases are used to inform the interpolation to each location. A host of different interpolation methods exist [e.g. @conolly2020] which, along with the impact of adjusting the parameter settings for the IDW, would clearly be worthwhile to explore (Potential backing 2.3). 

Warrant 3 concerns how the site limits are defined. As was outlined in Section \@ref(modifiable), site limits involves the arbitrary delineation of continuous phenomena represented by the distribution of archaeological artefacts in the landscape. Furthermore, the distribution of artefacts need not represent the entire area making up the activity areas of past inhabitants at a location. For example the landing area for boats, which presumably has relevance for the location of a site relative to the sea (see also below), can hardly be assumed to be directly reflected in artefact distributions. Deflection 3.2 states that while all of these are valid points, I believe the distances considered means that these dimensions will have relatively limited influence on the final results. 

Warrant 4 pertains to the digital terrain model (DTM) that is used to model the Mesolithic landscape. While erosion and modern disturbances has impacted the DTM, this was attempted to be accounted for using a 10 m resolution DTM that is a down-sampled version of the 1 m resolution DTM provided by the Norwegian Mapping Authority [@mapping2018], and by manually defining and interpolating the elevation values over especially problematic areas such highways and quarries. Again, while I believe this to have been largely successful.     

Warrant 5 states that for the modelling efforts to hold, the precise details for how the distance between site and shoreline was measured is a central component. This pertains both to how the shoreline and the site limits (see Warrant 3) are defined, and what methods were used for the measuring of the distances. Central aspects here is that the displacement curves used to define the position of the shoreline represent the mean sea-level. For the definition of the site limits, Deflection 3.2 from above is relevant also here, while Potential backing 5.5 suggests that both including an estimate of the tidal range and potentially exploring the definition and uncertainty associated with the delineation of the site limits could be worked into the simulation procedure. 

Furthermore, the distances measured was the vertical distance between the elevation of the shoreline and the lowest point on the site polygons, the distance between the horizontally closest points on the site and the shoreline, as well as the topographic distance (that is, the distance when accounting for the slope of the terrain) between the sites and the horizontally closest point on the shoreline. Especially the last measure entails some simplifications. Measuring the topographic distance to the horizontally closest points means that this does not necessarily identify the topographically closest points, which is a more computationally expensive operation. Furthermore, identifying the topographically shortest path between these points is also dependent on the choice of leas cost path algorithm. However, I still believe that the distances considered means that the assumptions and inferential leaps that this warrant requires will have a limited impact on the findings.      


\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1.05\linewidth]{figures/toulmin_p1} 

}

\caption{Central evidential arguments underlying Paper 1 and 2, presented as a argument schema drawing on Toulmin (1958) and Chapman and Wylie (2016).}(\#fig:t1)
\end{figure}

The last warrant, Warrant 6, pertains to the treatment of the data following the simulations. This was done by fitting an array of standard models to the univariate distribution of vertical elevation distances between sites and shoreline, and selecting the gamma as the best model by use of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Given the limited consideration of competeing models and the lack of a probability estimates for the parameters of the models, the study can ultimately be considered the first part of modular model construction, where this study represents a first step [e.g. @buck1996; @gelman2020].

Finally, the study does not involve any consideration of what factors have caused the distribution of elevation values -- reflected in the use of the univariate data and choice of models. In one way this can therefore be viewed as an instrumental model as the *reason* for the location of the sites has not been considered explicitly. The concern is directed towards prediction not explanation. By combining the present altitude of a site, its likely elevation above the shoreline when it was in use, as informed by the gamma function, and local shoreline displacement curves, this model makes it possible to assign a probabilistic absolute shoreline date to coastal sites in the region. On a realist view, however, it is still true that the treatment of the data and the conception of the model followed from an underlying belief of what mechanisms shaped the patterns in the data deemed relevant. While the model and derived method can be viewed as a instrumental dating tool, they are determined by the proclivity for sites to be located on the shoreline. As such, they are likely to be tightly integrated with both overarching cultural developments, as well as behaviour at the site level. By extension, the multitude of factors that can have shaped the site-sea relationship on the large and small scale, both temporally and spatially, offers a challenging causal web of possible interacting effects that ultimately determine this relationship. Having first derived this instrumental model, this gives opportunity both to further test its correspondence with other empirical data, and explore and expound underlying theoretical assumptions and implications. 

To illustrate this, below I have constructed a suggestion for a causal model concerning what determines the vertical distance between coastal Mesolithic sites and the shoreline in south-eastern Norway. 

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/dag_paper1} 

}

\caption{Suggested causal model for the drivers behind the relationship between site location and the prehistoric shoreline in Mesolithic south-eastern Norway.}(\#fig:d1)
\end{figure}

The immediately obvious aspect of the model is that the effect of all variables for the the site-sea relationship is mediated through the variables site exposure, which pertains to the exposure of the location to wind and wave action, and site accessibility, which pertain to how easily the site could have been reached. As was stated above, the most 

A likely important factor for how exposed and accessible people accepted a site to be is the purpose of the visit to the site. The purpose of the visit is therefore given a direct effect on exposure and accessibility. For example, is the site meant to be used as a stop to rest and repair tools, to be used as a hunting camp or a location from where to acquire raw-materials for tool-production? Is it a base-camp for the entire residential group from where further forays are made, or is it meant to be a meeting place for several groups? The purpose of the stay is likely also to impact the length of the stay, which in turn might have implications for how close to the shoreline the site is established. A longer stay could for example mean that the site is more withdrawn from the shoreline, so as to make sure storm surges do not reach the site. 

Means of travel is also included in the model. Most travel in the coastal region is assumed to have been done by boat in this period, which means accessibility to the site from the sea is likely to be of concern, as well the ability to safely beach and store the boats. However, what kind of boats that were in use does remain a point of discussion [see e.g. @glorstad2013 with comments and @schmitt2013], and could have implications for these dimensions. Furthermore, some travel was also likely done by foot [see @schulke2023]. This could for example be from a base-camp to a site close by for gathering and processing resources, where the need for the carrying capacity offered by boats might not have been necessary. Travel by sledge on the ice is also a possible alternative. Not having to land boats could presumably have implications for how exposed and accessible a location could be.

The season also presumably has implications for how often one had to establish camp, and possibly reducing mobility in colder periods [cf. @binford1990]. The season might also have implications for the kinds of dwelling structures that were necessary to erect, and likely determines the kinds of resources that were exploited, thus potentially impacting the purpose of the stay. The season is also believed to have implications for the degree of wind and wave-action at a location, thus affecting the exposure of the site to the elements, and impacting accessibility. Finally, the season presumably also has implications for the means of travel, for example by enabling the use of sledges in winter-time and reducing the potential use of boats. Season is therefore given a direct effect on all of these variables.

Some variables and nuance that have been left out of the model are worth commenting on. The weather is for example likely to impact a lot of these factors, but is near, if not entirely impossible to determine archaeologically. Furthermore, the purpose of the stay is here indicated using a single variable, but a stay need not, or perhaps likely did not, have a single purpose. A simple example might be a case where multiple kinds of resources were to be exploited from a site. A possible alternative would be to operationalise these as individual variables, where for example the magnitude of seal-hunting and the gathering of hazelnuts to be done from the site is kept as separate variables. These would in turn likely be determined by factors such as the density of these resources in the landscape, their caloric return, their cost in terms of handling-time and -energy, and the potential prestige associated with hunting a specific animal species. 

Furthermore, the entire picture is also further complicated by other latent variables that are left of the model. Social structure, overarching mobility patterns, territoriality, group size and composition, as well as religious beliefs could all impact land-use, site-structure and ultimately how sites were positioned relative to the sea. The proposed causal model thus pertains, as was noted above, to what can be termed proximal causes.  

Nonetheless, I still believe the model forms a reasonable starting point from where to potentially improve the baseline model, and that it has the potential to reveal some important causal determinants for the site-sea relationship. A central challenge is of course how these factors are to be operationalised and determined archaeologically. The exercise of setting up the causal model is still useful in its own right, if not simply by forcing its author to think through and concretise what elements they believe are important and how these are related, but it also forms a framework that dictates how these variables would have to be handled statistically. 

### Operationalising the site-sea model

A central challenge for the proposed model is how the different variables can be measured. For example, determining the season for when a site was in use is possibly an insurmountable challenge, but some avenues for investigation exist. The most immediate line of evidence is drawing on faunal and vegetational material from sites. Depending on what resources were exploited, this could make it possible to discern in what season the sites were in use  [e.g. @bergsvik2011]. Furthermore, @solheim2016 speculated whether what they identified as a predominance of fish on sites located in outer coastal areas, as opposed to terrestrial faunal material at sites in inner coastal areas, could reflect seasonal movement patterns. As bone is typically poorly preserved in the acidic Norwegian soils, this is a challenging line of evidence to draw on, but if this could be shown to consistently correspond to other site features, it could possibly be extended to sites where bone is not preserved. 

Similarly challenging is determining the means of travel. While boats can be reasonably be assumed to have been the main means of transportation throughout the Mesolithic in the coastal region, it has been suggested that sledges and skis could have been used in inland areas [see @sørensen2013]. The relevance of these alternatives has to my knowledge not been extensively explored in the context of coastal Norwegian Mesolithic archaeology. Thus, although the relevance of this variable is therefore not certain, and these suggestions remain speculative, one line of reasoning could be to examine he topographic location of the site, possibly also combined with insights into resource-use and site function.

When it comes to measuring the length of stay, it was suggested in the third paper of this thesis [@roalkvam2022], as presented in more detail below, that aspects of the lithic inventories reflect the duration of stays at the sites under study. Assessing the distance between site and shoreline when accounting for these measures could therefore offer a way forward in this regard. While the length and purpose of the stays are likely to be tightly integrated, the analysis of lithic inventories offer a clear possibility for approaching these issues.

Exposure is one of the variables in the suggested causal models where the
The exposure of Mesolithic sites was investigated in @roalkvam2020 by using viewshed analysis to estimate visibility, and the estimation of wind-fetch to measure exposure to wave-action. A third potential way to handle exposure could be to devise a method for estimating the distance from the site to the outer-most coastal feature at the time the site was in use. Although all of these measures have seen limited or no previous application in Norwegian archaeology, they offer clear ways forward with which to investigate these issues.

Finally, accessibility is another challenging variable to operationalise that has not been explored much in the literature. Good landing places for boats are often pointed to in excavation reports and in the literature, but precisely what this entails is not always as clear. A common feature appears to be a gentle slope towards the prehistoric shoreline, which can readily be explored in a GIS. Furthermore, the exposure of the site location to wave-action is another relevant measure here, and so there does exist potential.

As it stands the most readily implemented explanatory variables of the model is therefore the duration of the stays at the site, their exposure to surrounding landscape, and potentially the accessibility to the sites. The most challenging are those of seasonality and means of travel. To conclude, this exercise has demonstrated the value of suggesting an explicit causal model, and has laid out some potential avenues for further interrogating the issue of the relationship between coastal Mesolithic sites and the contemporaneous shoreline.

## Modelling the technological expediency of Mesolithic assemblages 
\sectionmark{Modelling the expediency of lithic assemblages}

The third paper of this thesis [@roalkvam2022] was aimed at exploring methods and approaches for handling lithic assemblages associated with the large number of excavated Mesolithic sites in the region, which can range in size from a few hundred to several thousands artefacts. The 55 sites chosen for analysis were excavated as part of four large excavation projects undertaken by the Museum of Cultural History within the last two decades, and were located within a constrained geographical area. As this means that the excavations were carried out using similar excavation methods and that the classification of the artefact inventories followed similar guidelines, the choice of sample was aimed at reducing the amount of variation in the assemblages that could follow simply from investigatory and classificatory differences. The analysis focused on two analytical avenues. The first of these was using correspondence analysis to evaluate the chronological development in the occurrence of artefact categories over time, which in large part appears to coincide with previous suggestions in the literature. The second line of investigation aimed at exploring methods for tracking variation in mobility patterns based on the composition of lithic inventories. It is the second part of the analysis that is focused on here, and which is presented in the argument schema in Figure \@ref(fig:t3).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1.05\linewidth]{figures/toulmin_p3} 

}

\caption{Central evidential arguments underlying Paper 3, presented as a argument schema drawing on Toulmin (1958) and Chapman and Wylie (2016).}(\#fig:t3)
\end{figure}

The evidential claim of the paper is that the forager--collector continuum, as outlined in Section \@ref(mobility), is captured by variables taken from the Whole Assemblage Behavioural Index [see @clark2017]. Specifically, this involves the   

The first warrant pertains to the issue of whether the artefact inventories have been consistently categorised across reports. The support for this can initially be found in the sample of sites that was chosen for the study, which was aimed at being likely to have artefact inventories that were categorised using similar methods. To add to this, the key variables of the WABI, namely proportion of secondarily worked lithics and volumetric density of lithics, are both variables that have had the same definition for decades [cf. @helskog1976]. Consequently, while the sample itself makes this rebuttal likely to be of less concern, part of the value of the WABI is that these variables lend themselves well to studies of legacy data where more modern classificatory schemas have not been used [Backing 1.3; ]. However, some ancillary expectation of the WABI was not found to correspond to the suggested developments. This especially pertains to the role of cores. One expectation of the WABI is that un-exhausted cores is likely to be more frequent in assemblages characterised by a lower degree of mobility, but no clear chronological patterning could be identified in the frequency of cores present in the assemblages. However, this could be related to the fact that these are often not classified beyond being categorised as cores, and so a more in-depth analysis might reveal different patterns related to dimensions such as the exhaustion of the cores. While the analysis of cores need not employ this methodology, this point can be related to Potential backing 1.4 in the argument schema, where a more principled analysis of the artefact inventories by the use of geometric morphometric is suggested [see e.g. @matzig2021; @shott2010].

Warrant 2 concerns the chronological control for the accumulation of the lithic assemblages. 17 of the 55 sites were associated with radiocarbon dates which were seen as relevant to the occupation of the sites in the original reports. Multiple dates from a single site were then treated by use of the Boundary and Sum functions in OxCal, and so the same points as those discussed for radiocarbon dates in relation to Paper 1 in Section \@ref(shoremodel) are also relevant here. More critical is the fact that as Paper 3 was written before Paper 1 and 2, the newly developed method for shoreline dating was not applied. Instead, the shoreline dates were taken directly from the reports. While I found in the first paper  that previous applications of shoreline dating generally corresponded with the start dates of the ones achieved with the newly proposed method, they did appear to overestimate the precision of the full date [@roalkvam2023, 11--15]. This can in part follow from the fact that the excavation reports also draw on typological information and not only shoreline dating, thus constraining the date, but this is done in an informal manner and so it is difficult to assess the degree to which the precision achieved in the reports can be justified. The chronological control could therefore be somewhat exaggerated for Paper 3, and so a clear point of improvement would be to undertake the study using the new method for shoreline dating.

Warrant 3 and 4 can be treated in unison here, as they concern whether the curated--expedient continuum is meaningfully captured by the variables of the WABI, and whether this in turn reflect the forager-collector continuum as originally devised by @binford1980. As is indicated by the title of the paper *Exploring the composition of lithic assemblages in Mesolithic south-eastern Norway*, the paper is explicitly exploratory. This means that it was aimed at identifying empirical patterns and suggest some potential explanations for their occurrence. The study thus decidedly entailed *post hoc* accommodative argumentation (see Section \@ref(confronting)), as the explanations were construed following the identification of the empirical patterns. These patterns correspond to those that could be expected from the main components of the WABI, previous suggestions for the development of mobility patterns through the Mesolithic of south-eastern Norway, and with the corresponding increased use of non-flint material through the period. However, given this explorative and accommodative analytical framework additional testing of the framework using independent data                                                                                                       
The causal model that underlies this relationship is fairly straightforward in that it posits that degree of residential mobility has a direct effect on the degree of expedient technological organisation. This follows from the assumption that a reduction in mobility leads to a better predictability of raw material availability and allows for its accumulation at sites occupied for a longer duration. With increased occupational duration, the tasks that will have to be carried out are also believed to more predictable than in a situation of high mobility, where changing and more unpredictable circumstances will lead to a more curated technology. This model is presented visually in Figure.  

Central here, however, is that while the distance to the shoreline has a relatively straightforward relationship between empirical measurement and the underlying theoretical construct, the same can not be said for the relationship between the components of the WABI and the more abstract theoretical concept of technological expediency. While there are some theoretical questions pertaining for example to precisely how the shoreline and site limits are defined, far more controversy and uncertainty exists in the definition of the expedient--curated technological continuum and what empirical effect this has on the indicator variables. While the difference beween causality and. The question then becomes on Given that the variables are taken to be effect indicators. Given that the indicators influences the latent variable [@bollen2015].

## Modelling demographic developments through the Mesolithic
\sectionmark{Modelling demographic developments}

The fourth and final paper of the thesis, written in collaboration with Steinar Solheim, contrasts proxies that have often been drawn on to model relative population size over time. These are the summed probability distribution of radiocarbon dates (RSPD), and, drawing on paper 1 and 2, the summed probability distribution of shoreline dates (SSPD).

The first warrant pertains to the degree to which the frequency of radiocarbon dates reflect population numbers. This is based on the fundamental premise that more dateable material from a period is a reflection of more people who have deposited this material. Some issues that have been argued to potentially confound this premise is taphonomic loss, different cultural or economical practices that could result in variable output of dateable material irrespective of population density, and investigatory biases that could impact the number of radiocarbon dates that are carried out for specific contexts or time-intervals. Some methodological solutions have been presented to account for such biases, such as adjustments to account for taphonomic loss, sample selection that is likely to derive from populations with similar economic systems, and methods for weighting multiple radiocarbon dates from the same context to reduce investigatory bias. However, without independent evidence for the connection between RSPDs and population dynamics for a given context, an inferential leap is nonetheless necessary. One approach that many authors therefore agree can make such inferences more robust is to compare the agreement between multiple population proxies.

The second warrant first pertains to the degree to which shoreline dating is a reliable method for dating coastal Stone Age sites in the region, and is thus premised on the argument schema for Paper 1 and 2. Furthermore, while the frequency of shoreline dated sites is likely not entirely divorced from the number of people responsible for their occurrence, the mismatch that was found between the two proxies led us to hypothesise that the frequency of shoreline dated sites is to a large extent determined by mobility patterns. 

This is thus also heavily dependent on the method for shoreline dating, the major uncertainties of which is presented above (Section \@ref(shoremodel)).

The fourth paper thus mainly provides a methodological framework for assembling and assessing the summed probability distribution of shoreline dated sites. With a comparison with the RSPD, this led to the development of a hypothesised relationship between the variables. This is presented as a DAG in Figure. Exploring and adjudicating between such potential explanations will ultimately depend on drawing on the other variables in the DAG as well. The suggested DAG highlights the degree of residential patterns and environmental developments such as the rate of relative sea-level change, oceanographic developments and precipitation and temperature changes that have frequently been demonstrated to be of relevance for demographic developments. The rate of relative sea-level change can be directly derived from the displacement curves and can therefore readily be drawn on in future studies. Data for variation is sea-surface temperature is also available for the the mid- to late Holocene of Skaggerrak, offering another potential analytical avenue. Furthermore, if the framework from Paper 3 can be expanded upon and given a more solid evidential foundation, this can be compared and potentially be used to adjust the SSPD for variation in mobility patterns.

Another dimension that is likely to be critical for the exploration of the hypotheses presented in Paper 4 is the inclusion of a larger study area. This will thus depend on a extension of the method for shoreline dating and for assessing lithic inventories in terms of mobility patterns. 

## Chapter summary
This chapter has laid out the arguments and evidential claims that underlie each of the four papers of the thesis. Furthermore, developing explicit hypotheses have been argued by many to reduce accommodative argumentation, thereby reducing research bias, increasing reproducibility and potentially facilitate a move towards unveiling causality [see last chapter and e.g. @betts2021; @platt1964]. Consequently, the chapter also presented suggestions for causal graphs pertaining to the empirical patterns identified in the papers, aimed at offering some potential avenues for future research.
