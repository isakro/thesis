# The Norwegian Mesolithic
This chapter presents the context of the study. This starts by laying out the general environmental developments in the period, before the general archaeological discussions and understandings of the period is laid out. While insights from studies undertaken in Norway and Sweden will be drawn on at times, the general focus is that of developments in south-eastern Norway.


## Environmental setting

The environmental setting for the Mesolithic in Scandinavia is first and foremost defined by the end of the Weichselian and the retreat of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet [see @skar2018; @skar2022, 106--109]. Most pronounced of the resulting environmental impacts is the melting of the ice sheet itself, corresponding eustatic sea-level change and isostatic rebound, changes in the ocean currents, as well as the developments of the Baltic Sea, which transitioned between being open and closed off from the North Sea.

The global climate reconstructions based on oxygen isotopes from the Greenland ice cores indicate a gradual heating throughout the period, interspersed with cold events c. 10 300 cal BP, c. 9200 cal BP and 8200 cal BP. However, how these events played out locally and what consequences this development had for local ecosystems and human populations appears to vary quite dramatically across Northern Europe and thus cannot be assumed a priori to have been of relevance or concern for the societies dealt with in this thesis. 

### Climactic oscilations


Regional increase in temperature and perticipation rates from the early Preboreal, followed by mild winters and humid conditions in the Boreal with the Holocene Thermal Maximum, locally dated to c. 6400--2400 BCE.  

At the transition to the Boreal, the vegetation in the region goes from arctic vegetation characterised by to  

### Sea-level change
Following the retreat of the ice


Depending on the scale of, sea-level change can impact not only the habitational suitability of any individual location, but can have far-reaching effects that impact shoreline morphology, drainage systems and [e.g. @gross2018; @astrup2018]. While the at times dramatic magnitude of these changes would have required a response from human populations inhabiting the impacted areas, it is by no means given that these would have negative consequences for these societies. In fact, areas impacted by sea-level change can be attractive for hunting, fishing and gathering precisely because of these factors. The study of human response to sea-level change should therefore not assume that this would be the result of. How sea-level change impacts the population of any given area will thus depend on a wide range of factors pertaining to the amplitude of shoreline displacement, the topographic setting, and the nature of the societal systems which respond to these changes.

## Archaeological background

Having presented the environmental developments of the period, the following section gives a general outline of how chronological and societal developments in the Mesolithic have been characterised and understood archaeologically. The first focused research on the Norwegian Mesolithic is ascribed @hansen1904, who studied the material that @brøgger1905 later saw as a defining element of the Nøstvet culture [@bjerck2008, 61]. In 1909, Nummedal made discoveries of flint artefacts in western Norway that were deemed likely to have an earlier date than the Nøstvet material [@rygh1911; @nummedal1912], and which led to the subsequent definition of another cultural unit termed Fosna [@nummedal1924]. Nummedal later also discovered material in northern Norway that had parallels with, but was considered distinct from Fosna and which was given the label Komsa [@nummedal1927]. While the geographical and temporal relationship between these cultural units were recognised as unresolved and was subject to much debate, the common understanding was for many decades that southern Norway was defined by the chronologically sequential phases Fosna and Nøstvet, while Komsa was seen as defining of the entire Mesolithic period in northern Norway [see e.g. @indrelid 1978:147]. With renewed debates in the 1970s that were arguably founded on a better understanding of lithic technology [@bjerck1994], significant changes to the chronological framework was proposed.  @mikkelsen1975 suggested a tripartite division of the Mesolithic in south-eastern Norway by dividing the period into the Early, Middle and Late Mesolithic. This was in turn also subdivided 

 
The traditional chronological framework for the Mesolithic of south-eastern Norway has followed along the general lines of that presented by @glorstad2010[23, see table]. Recently this has been. The degree to which the chronological shifts are. While they form a natural frame for the narrative structure of this text, these should not been seen as the impact of strict periodisation is to some extent counteracted by treating. This will be treated in more detail in the next chapter 

In a comprehensive reassessment that also includes results from the last decades of excavations, @reitan2022 has recently suggested a new chronological framework for the Mesolithic period in south-eastern Norway [also @reitan2016]. As his focus has mainly been on technological and typo-chronologcal developments, and given their recent date of publication, this chronological framework has yet to be comprehensively evualuated in terms of correspondence with other societal developments. The presentation of major chronological trends in the sections below thus follows the traditional periodisation. However, in the discussion chapter, the results of this thesis will also be seen in relation to the framwework suggested by Reitan.

The following sections will outline general societal developments believed to characterise the Norwegian Mesolithic, divided into the periods Early Mesolithic (EM; 9300--8300 BCE), Middle Mesolithic (MM; ) and Late Mesolithc (LM; . While focus is on south-eastern Norway, reference to a wider context and neighbouring regions in Norway and Sweden when perspectives

Following the excavation of the site Tørkop in Østfold in the mid-1970s [@mikkelsen1999], a few decades would pass until sites from the period were excavated in south-eastern Norway. Through the 90s and early 2000s sites were excavated as part of larger projects in Akershus [] and Østfold [including five unpublished sites from Halden @]. From the mid-2000s onwards larger projects in Vestfold and Telemark [@solheim2017b; @melvold2014b] as well as Aust-Agder [@reitan2018c] The excavation of sites such as Rødbøl 54 in and Anvik in marks the start of this, with larger projects such as E18 Bommestad-Sky, Vestfoldbaneprosjektet and E18 Tvedestrand-Arendal subsequently increasing the data on the MM substantially.

### The Early Mesolithic (9300--8300 BCE)

The first human presence in Norway is recorded from around 9300 BCE, which marks the start of the EM. A central discussion has concerned whether people first migrated into the area of present-day Norway from a route along the coast of western Sweden, from the north-east along the northern-Norwegian coast [@bjørn1929], or across the Norwegian trench to south-western Norway from the the North Sea Plain [Doggerbank, @odner1966, 135--136]. The most recent evidence suggest that a crossing from Doggerbank would not have been feasible due to the distances involved at the time [@glorstad2016; @glorstad2017]. The present consensus is therefore that the earliest human dispersal into present-day Norway is likely to have originated on the coast of western Sweden around 9500--9300 BCE [e.g. @glorstad2020; @bjerck2008; @bjerck2021]. From here, human occupation is believed to have rapidly extended along most of the Norwegian coastline, while a north-eastern migration reached Kola and northern Norway some time before 9000 BCE [@manninen2021]. These two routes are associated with the genetically defined 'western' hunter-gatherers that migrated from the south, and 'eastern' hunter-gatherers migrating from the north [@gunther2018], each identifiable also in terms of distinct material culture and technological traits [@manninen2021].

 <!-- (f.eks. Bjerck 2008c:74; Glørstad 2010a:91-93) -->

Pioneer sites in Norway and Western Sweden have traditionally been ascribed the archaeological cultures or techno-complexes Fosna and Hensbacka, respectively. Today these are seen as representing the same phenomena [e.g. @bjerck2008, 75]. Fosna/Hensbacka sites are to hold fairly homogeneous lithic inventories, and are held by many as having a common origin tracing back to South-Scandinavian and North-European Palaeolithic Ahrensburg groups [e.g. @bjerck2008; @schmitt2009; @bang-andersen2012; @fuglestvedt2012]. The analyses of artefact inventories, the presence of high-quality South-Scandinavian flint, and the chronological support of radiocarbon dates and shoreline dates have in sum led to the consensus on this continental connection (see Fischer 1996; Schmitt et al. 2006; @fuglestvedt2007; @fuglestvedt2009; @bang-andersen2012; @glorstad2016). 

The similarities has led @fuglestvedt2012[8] to propose that the terms Fosna/Hensbacka be abandoned altogether, in favour of Ahrensburg, as this would accentuate the continental elements that appear so defining for these pioneer sites. Although this has been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm [e.g. @bjerck2008, 73; @åstveit2014, with comments], particularly by those emphasising the strong marine orientation of the Fosna/Hensbacka, there has also been the occasional use of variations such as 'coastal Ahrensburg' to denote the Fosna/Hensbacka [@prøsch-danielsen1995]. Following a recent analysis of lithic inventories from the transition from the Palaeolithic to the Mesolithic in Northern Europe, and comparison with Fosna/Hensbacka sites in Norway and Sweden, @berg-hansen2017[] has argued that the Fonsa/Hensbacka sites have a clear similarity with EM Maglemose sites in Denmark. While there are elements of this technology that point back to the Ahrensburg, there is also a clear break with the Palaeolithic technology. She therefore argues that these societies should, as with the Maglemose, be considered Mesolithic and not a northern continuation of Palaeolithic life-ways. At any rate, these discussions do go to show that there is a clear affinity between the first human population on the Scandinavian Peninsula and continental hunter-gatherer groups.

To account for this apparent pan-regional homogeneity, a central question is by what process Norway and western Sweden were initially colonised [e.g. @bjerck2009; @schmitt2009; @bang-andersen2012; @fuglestvedt2012; @glorstad2016; @berg-hansen2017]. An important aspect in this regard is the fact that the coastal areas in western Norway were largely ice-free around 3000 years before the first recorded human presence in Norway [@mangerud2022], and must have been rich and desirable areas in terms of resources [@bjerck1994; @bjerck 2009; @bang-andersen2012; @glorstad 2016]. Bjerck [@bjerck1994; @bjerck2008, 85; @bjerck2009, @bjerck2017] has explained the fact that people did not start exploiting these regions until around 9300 BC with reference to less developed marine subsistence strategies among North-European hunter-gatherer groups. The coastal location of the majority of Fosna/Hensbacka sites will undoubtedly have necessitated extensive adjustment to marine environments, including by the use of boats. Following the delay induced by this, the hunting of seal, conceptually not that different from the hunting of large terrestrial mammals, might have spurred an increased development of boating technology, while at the same time lending itself to the continued use of a continental artefact inventory [@bjerck2009; @bjerck2016]. Proficient and effective use of boats might in turn have resulted in a relatively rapid colonisation of Fosna/Hensbacka areas, possibly as fast as over a period of only 200--300 years [@bjerck1994; @bang-andersen2012], providing a possible explanation for the homogeneous assemblages. These could reflect mobility of a kind not allowing for familiarisation with local resources for tool production, nor the development of distinct inventories adjusted to various geographical settings. The assemblages might therefore represent a sort of catch-all tool-kit, suitable to meet the variable demands of a \'pioneer condition\' [@bjerck2017; see also @breivik2016]. Furthermore, @berg-hansen2017[232] has argued that the homogeneity in the lithic inventories could be related to relatively high population numbers with closely knit social ties, which in combination has enabled this technological conservatism. Homogeneity and continuity in lithic technology over vast expanses of Scandinavia would be difficult to envision with a thinly spread population consisting of more isolated groups.   

In general, the Early Mesolithic in Norway is understood as characterised by highly mobile groups [@bjerck1994; @bjerck2008; @åstveit2009; @fuglestvedt2012], reflected by what is typically interpreted at small sites located at exposed locations in the landscape [e.g. @nyland2012], and lighter more expedient dwelling structures in the form of tent-like structures [e.g. @åsteveit2009; @fretheim2017, 219].  As there is little organic material on which to base inferences on subsistence, there is little direct evidence to go on when attempting to determine what available resources made up the diet of people in Norway in the first centuries of human occupation. Given the North-European origin of the first humans in Norway, the hunting of reindeer has been suggested to be a possible driver behind the initial colonisation. However, the EM sites are mainly found along the coast, and so there is little doubt that aquatic resources have played an important and likely dominating role [@indrelid1978; @bjerck2008; @bang-andersen2012; @fuglestvedt2014; @svendsen2018]. It can, however, not be excluded that various species of land mammals, fowl and flora have also been important constituents of the diet [@åstveit2014; @fuglestvedt2014; @mansrud2018]. While the settlement is focused on the coast, there is also a presence in the mountain regions of south- and north-western Norway from a very early stage, which is believed to have been related to the hunting of reindeer [@hagen1963; @bang-andersen2012; @svendsen2018]. Furthermore, @mansrud2018 argue that increasing temperatures, the reduced influence from the melting ice sheet, the Gulf stream, combined with microliths that are to be associated with bow arrow technology, indicates a wider spectrum of resource exploitation that what a one-sided focus on either seal or reindeer in the literature might suggest.   

Given the lack of direct evidence for subsistence strategies, the analysis of settlement patterns and overall palaeoecological developments is typically drawn on to make general inferences regarding this question. The coastal EM sites have been characterised as having a tendency to be situated on small islands and been exposed to 

As a counterpoint, some authors have argued that the differences between settlement patterns in the EM and later periods have been exaggerated or are not properly understood [see @glorstad2013; @åstveit2014]. Furthermore, in a recent study I found that the settlement patterns in a subregion of south-eastern Norway was fairly similar across the EM, MM and LM [@roalkvam2020]. Of the considered variables, the most important driver of settlement patterns was found to be degree of exposure, where the sites were found to be located with relatively open immediate surroundings, while at the same time being sheltered from larger stretches of open sea. However, one of the locational patterns that was not considered was the location of the sites within the wider landscape. The term exposure has been used to denote both how commanding the view would have been from the sites and how exposed the sites would have been to wind and wave-action [@svendsen2014], but has also pertained to their location relative to deeper fjords and outermost coast [e.g. @lindblom1984; @jaksland2001; @bergsvik2001; @bjerck2008; @svendsen2018]. It has been argued that EM sites would have mainly been located on the outer coast, and that the fjords were not utilised until a later stage. This is argued to reflect a focus on the hunting of marine mammals, especially seal, in the EM.     


Coupled to this discussion is also what motivated the initial human dispersion into these territories. 

The blade technology of the Early Mesolithic is based on single- and dual-platform one-sided cores, typically by means of direct percussion [@solheim2020].  

Some central discussion that linger in the literature concerned with the period pertains to the nature of the first colonisation of Norway. Did the coastal areas represent an unprecedented opportunity in an extended Garden of Eden, or an obstacle to be overcome. Furthermore, discussions pertaining to the degree of mobility and unified nature of lithic assemblages 


### The Middle Mesolithic (8300--5600 BCE)
While the Middle Mesolithic (MM) was defined as a separate typo-chronological phase in the 1970s, @bjerck2008[92--98] stated as late as 2008 that the period was associated with a limited archaeological material, thus posing an analytical challenge. This is in part related to sea-level transgressions in this period along the coast of southern and western Norway. In south-eastern Norway, which has not been subject to sea-level transgression, the lack of MM material could in part be related to the fact that MM sites are located at elevations that have historically not been impacted by the expansion of infrastructure, and thus not targeted by archaeological investigations [@jaksland2001, 27]. This picture has changed dramatically over the last few decades, however, and in addition to more isolated excavations an expansive MM material has been investigated by projects such as E18 Bommestad-Sky, Vestfoldbanseprosjektet and E18 Tvedestrand-Arendal.

Discussion pertaining to the MM have in part been concerned with whether the period has more in common with the highly mobile societies of the EM or with what was is typically seen as more semi-sedentary LM societies [e.g. @mansrud2014; @solheim2016; @berg-hansen2022]. There is a clear shift in material technology around the end of the 9th century BCE [@sørensen2013; @damlien2016; @eymundsson2018; @solheim2020a; @bergsvik2015; @mansrud2018], which coincides with a genetic mix between populations originally migrating to the Scandinavian Peninsula from the south and those extending southwards from the north-east [@gunther2018; @manninen2021; @skar2022]. However, several aspects of these societies are still believed to show similarities with the EM. For one, MM sites have, as with the EM sites, traditionally been seen as remnants of shorter stays [@jaksland2001]. Furthermore, based on sites from northern Vestfold, @berg-hansen2022[662] have argued that coastal settlement patterns in the start of the MM appear to be a continuation of those from the EM, characterised by a site location concentrated to the outer coast. 

However, as with the lithic technology, additional aspects of the MM show a clearer break with the preceding EM. @bjerkc2008 notes that the MM is characterised by a degree of regionalisation in the lithic material that is not evident in the EM material, and it has been suggested that the semi-sedentary traits of the LM can be traced back to the MM [@glorstad2010; @solheim2016; see also the third paper of this thesis, @roalkvam2022]. This also follows from the investigation of what has been interpreted as integrated settlement systems consisting of sites with different functions, as well as an increased use of locally occurring non-flint material. As pointed out by @berg-hansen2022, continuation in some aspects of the. 

While there appears to be a high diversity of dwelling structures from the MM, including some that are reminiscent of those from the EM, excavations of more substantial sunken dwelling-structures dated to the MM have been undertaken over the last decade [@solheim2013; @mjærum2018; @fretheim2017, 220; @berg-hansen2022]. The higher investment in time and resources that these dwelling structures represent has been taken by many to indicate an increased attachment to the area in which they were built []. 

Increased exploitation and possibly the establishment of [@mjærum2018]

While there are several taphonomic factors that might bias the preservation of faunal material [@solheim2016]. The Middle Mesolithic also 




In the Middle Mesolithic blades are produced from conical and sub-conical cores with a single platform using pressure and indirect percussion [].

### The Late Mesolithic (5600--3900 BCE)


Bergsvik [@bergsvik2001; @bergsvik2002] noted that large LM sites were located close to good fishing locations along straits and sees this as evidence for an increased degree of sedentism towards the end of the Mesolithic [@bergsvik2006].

Blade production in the Late Mesolithic is characterised by the introduction of handle cores [@eigeland2015]. As pointed out by @solheim2020[4], this involves a shift from cores that will result in blades of gradually diminishing size as the core is exhausted in the EM and MM, to cores that result in blades of a uniform and comparatively small size (i.e. microblades).
